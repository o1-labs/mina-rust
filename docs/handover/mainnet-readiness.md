# Mainnet Readiness

This document outlines the key features and improvements required for OpenMina to be ready for mainnet deployment.

## Critical Requirements

### 1. Persistence Implementation
**Status**: Draft design ([Issue #522](https://github.com/openmina/openmina/issues/522), see [persistence.md](persistence.md))

The ledger is currently kept entirely in memory, which is not sustainable for mainnet's scale. Persistence is required for:
- Reducing memory usage to handle mainnet-sized ledgers and amount of snarks.
- Enabling fast node restarts without full resync
- Supporting webnodes with browser storage constraints

**Note**: There is a very old implementation for on-disk storage in `ledger/src/ondisk` that was never used - a lightweight key-value store implemented to avoid the RocksDB dependency. This is unrelated to the new persistence design which intends to solve persistence for everything, not just the ledger. But the old implementation may be worth revisiting anyway.

### 2. Wide Merkle Queries
**Status**: Not implemented ([Issue #1086](https://github.com/openmina/openmina/issues/1086))

Wide merkle queries are needed for:
- Protocol compatibility
- Faster synchronization

### 3. Delta Chain Proof Verification
**Status**: Not implemented ([Issue #1017](https://github.com/openmina/openmina/issues/1017))

When verifying blocks, OpenMina should verify the delta chain proofs.

### 4. Automatic Hardfork Handling
**Status**: Not implemented

OpenMina needs a mechanism to automatically handle protocol hardforks to maintain compatibility with the Mina network. There is an implementation in progress for the OCaml node, and the Rust node should implement something compatible. However, we lack detailed knowledge of the OCaml implementation to provide specific guidance.

### 5. Security Audit
**Status**: Not performed

A comprehensive security audit by qualified third-party security experts is essential before mainnet deployment. This should cover cryptographic implementations, consensus logic, networking protocols, and potential attack vectors specific to the Rust implementation.

### 6. Mainnet Genesis Ledger Distribution
**Status**: Solution exists for devnet, mainnet needs implementation

The node requires efficient genesis ledger loading for practical operation. A binary genesis ledger must be produced for mainnet and included in the node distribution (or made downloadable from a location where the node can fetch it). Currently, mainnet genesis ledgers would be too large and expensive to process in JSON format.

**Current Implementation**: 
- Genesis ledgers are available in JSON format at [openmina-genesis-ledgers](https://github.com/openmina/openmina-genesis-ledgers) repository
- Devnet uses a prebuilt binary format (`genesis_ledgers/devnet.bin`) that loads very quickly
- The `tools/ledger-tool` utility can generate these binary formats

**Requirements for Mainnet**:
- Generate equivalent binary format for mainnet genesis ledger to ensure fast node startup
- Establish workflow for creating and distributing mainnet binary ledgers
- Implement process for updating binary ledgers after hardforks
- Handle potential devnet relaunch scenarios requiring new binary ledgers

**Note**: These binary ledger files would become deprecated once persistence is implemented, as the persisted database itself could be provided for initial node setup instead.

### 7. Error Sink Service Integration
**Status**: Partially implemented (PR #1097)

Currently, the node intentionally panics in recoverable error situations (such as block proof failures) to make errors highly visible during development. For mainnet deployment, this needs to transition to using the error sink service to report errors and continue operation instead of forcing node shutdown. This is critical for operational stability in production environments.

## Protocol Compliance and Feature Parity

### 1. Block Processing Deviation
Currently, only the best block is processed and broadcasted. See [this analysis](https://gist.github.com/tizoc/4a364dc2f8f29396a4097428a07f58d8) for details on this deviation from the full protocol.

### 2. SNARK Work Partitioner
Feature parity requirement for full node capabilities.

### 3. GraphQL API for SNARK Workers
Feature parity requirement for supporting external SNARK workers. SNARK workers need a proper API interface to:
- Submit completed work
- Query work requirements
- Coordinate with block producers

## Future Mina Compatibility

### 1. Dependency Updates
- Update proof-systems, ark, and other cryptographic dependencies to latest versions
- Ensure compatibility with future Mina protocol changes

### 2. App State Field Increase
Support for increasing app state from 8 to 32 fields, enabling more complex smart contracts and zkApps.

## Webnode-Specific Requirements

For webnodes to handle mainnet:
- Persistence implementation (see [persistence.md](persistence.md)) - critical for webnodes due to memory constraints, intermittent connectivity, and frequent restarts
- Memory usage constraints are manageable without block proving
- Block production for webnodes is not a priority since block producers are unlikely to use browser-based setups for production operations, so the separate WASM memory block ([Issue #1128](https://github.com/openmina/openmina/issues/1128)) may not be necessary

### zkApp Integration
A popular feature request from users is direct zkApp and webnode integration. This would allow zkApps to:
- Get better visibility into the network state
- Query the blockchain directly without relying on third-party nodes
- Avoid query limits imposed by external services
- Provide a more decentralized and reliable infrastructure for zkApp developers

Additionally, the webnode could be packaged as a Node.js library, enabling zkApp developers to build testing frameworks that take advantage of OpenMina's simulator capabilities for more comprehensive and realistic testing environments. In such testing setups, block production would use dummy proofs rather than full proof generation.

### Known Issues from Community Testing

During testing with ~100 webnode operators from the community, a few critical issues were identified. See the [official retrospective](https://minaprotocol.com/blog/retro-mina-web-node-testing) for complete details.

#### 1. Seed Node Performance
- **Issue**: Performance problems on the first day due to UDP socket management issues in the webrtc-rs library.
- **Resolution**: Switched from webrtc-rs to the C++ "datachannel" implementation, which performs worse but is more stable.
- **Future Improvement**: Using QUIC transport for webnode-to-server communication would also help with seed node performance (see [P2P Evolution Plan](p2p-evolution.md)).
- **Status**: Resolved for testing, but seed node scalability should be monitored for mainnet deployment.

#### 2. Memory Limitations
- **Issue**: Webnodes are limited to 4GB of memory due to WASM constraints. When nodes sometimes reached this limit during block proving, they became stuck or experienced major thread crashes.
- **Root Cause**: 
  - Block proving operations consuming excessive memory within the same memory space
  - WASM memory allocator limitations leading to fragmentation
- **Solutions**:
  - Moving the prover to its own WASM heap would alleviate the issue ([Issue #1128](https://github.com/openmina/openmina/issues/1128))
  - Memory limitations are less critical for nodes that don't produce and prove blocks
  - Implementing persistence (as per [persistence.md](persistence.md)) would considerably improve the situation

#### 3. Network Connectivity and Bootstrap Issues
- **Issue**: Many nodes had difficulty completing initial bootstrap, especially when the webnode or peers providing staged ledgers experienced network connectivity problems (instability, low bandwidth, high latency).
- **Impact**: Hard to finish initial sync for many community operators.
- **Note**: The RPC used to fetch the staged ledger is particularly problematic because it is very heavy and needs to download a lot of data in a single request. It would be a good idea to redesign this RPC, ideally enabling it to fetch parts from multiple peers in the same way that the snarked ledger sync process does.
- **Planned Solutions**:
  - Prefer server-side nodes for fetching initial ledgers instead of relying on other webnodes
  - Add support for wide merkle queries to reduce roundtrips and improve sync efficiency
  - Better peer selection algorithms for initial bootstrap

## Rollout Plan

### Testing Requirements

Before mainnet deployment, OpenMina requires extensive testing to ensure protocol compatibility and reliable operation. Note that OpenMina has already demonstrated stability in devnet environments: block producer nodes have run continuously for over two months without issues (only restarting for upgrades), and webnodes without block production have maintained perfect uptime for two continuous weeks without memory issues.

However, there are rare situations where produced blocks cannot be proven (or more precisely, where invalid proofs are produced). This is one of the primary areas requiring further investigation and resolution.

#### Scenario Testing Expansion
- **Significantly increase scenario tests** to cover edge cases and protocol interactions
- **Multi-node scenarios** testing various network configurations and failure modes
- **Long-running stability tests** to validate node behavior over extended periods
- **Compatibility testing** with OCaml nodes to ensure seamless network operation
- **Stress testing** under high transaction volume and network load

#### Protocol Compatibility Validation
- **Comprehensive testing against OCaml implementation** for all protocol interactions
- **Cross-implementation consensus testing** to verify identical blockchain state
- **P2P protocol compatibility** testing for message handling and propagation
- **RPC API compatibility** testing to ensure client applications work seamlessly

### Prover/Verifier Implementation Strategy Options

OpenMina has a full implementation of both prover and verifier in Rust. The prover includes many optimizations that make proving significantly faster than the original OCaml implementation, including optimizations for server-side proving. However, these implementations have not been audited, and auditing plus ongoing maintenance requires significant time and effort.

#### Option 1: Complete Rust Implementation
Continue using OpenMina's Rust prover and verifier implementations.

**Pros**: 
- Full control and better integration with the Rust codebase
- Significant performance improvements over OCaml implementation
- Single codebase without external dependencies

**Cons**: 
- Requires comprehensive security audit before mainnet deployment
- Ongoing maintenance and compatibility responsibilities
- More implementation work for any missing features

#### Option 2: OCaml Subprocess Integration
Reuse the proven OCaml prover and verifier implementations through subprocess services with wrapper services in the state machine to handle communication (similar to what OpenMina used before it had its own prover).

**Pros**: 
- Leverages battle-tested OCaml prover/verifier code
- Reduces implementation work and compatibility risks
- Faster path to mainnet readiness
- Proven correctness and performance

**Cons**: 
- Additional complexity in service management
- Cross-process communication overhead
- Dependency on OCaml runtime

**Implementation Approach for Option 2**:
- Create service interfaces for prover/verifier subprocess communication
- Implement subprocess lifecycle management (start, restart, health checks)
- Design efficient data serialization for cross-process communication
- Add comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms

#### Webnode-Specific Considerations

**Essential Verifier Requirements**: All webnodes need verifiers for:
- Block proof verification
- zkApp proof verification  
- Transaction proof verification

**Block Production Capability**: Webnodes can produce and prove blocks, but this may not be a rollout priority.

**Implementation Strategy for Webnodes**:
- **Rust verifier implementation**: Much smaller and simpler than prover, making it easier to review, verify correctness, and maintain
- **Prover considerations**: If webnode block production isn't prioritized initially, prover implementation can be deferred
- **Alternative approaches**: If Rust verifier proves challenging, alternative verification methods need investigation
- **Hybrid approach**: Rust verifiers for webnodes, OCaml subprocess for full node provers when needed

### Deployment Phases

1. **Extended Testnet Testing** - Months of testing with comprehensive scenario coverage
2. **Limited Mainnet Beta** - Controlled deployment with selected nodes, potentially with block production disabled
3. **Initial Mainnet Rollout** - Non-block-producing nodes for network health safety
   - Verification-only deployment for both server-side and webnodes
   - Allows earlier rollout while building confidence
   - Reduces risk to network stability
4. **Block Production Enablement** - Enable block proving in later releases when confidence is established
5. **Full Production** - Complete mainnet readiness with all features enabled

**Rollout Strategy Benefits**:
- **Earlier deployment**: Verification-only nodes can be deployed sooner
- **Network safety**: Reduces risk of consensus issues during initial rollout
- **Gradual feature introduction**: Block production can be added once the core node functionality is proven stable
- **Confidence building**: Allows time to validate node behavior before enabling block production

## Summary

The most critical items for mainnet readiness are:
- **Persistence** - Without this, nodes may not be able to handle mainnet's ledger and snark pool size
- **Wide Merkle Queries** - Needed for compatibility and faster sync
- **Delta Chain Verification** - Required for protocol compliance
- **Hardfork Handling** - Essential for network compatibility
- **Security Audit** - Third-party security review before mainnet deployment
