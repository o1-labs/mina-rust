## Glossary of Key Terms

### Core Architecture Terms

**Redux Pattern** - State management architecture where all state changes happen through actions processed by reducers. Provides predictable state updates and easy debugging.

**Action** - Data structure representing a state change request. Can be stateful (handled by reducers) or effectful (handled by effects).

**Reducer** - Pure function that takes current state and an action, returns new state. In new-style components, also handles action dispatching.

**Effect** - Side-effect handler that interacts with external services. Should be thin wrappers around service calls.

**Enabling Condition** - Function that determines if an action is valid in the current state. Prevents invalid state transitions.

**State Machine** - Component that manages a specific domain's state through actions and reducers (e.g., P2P, block producer).

**Stateful Action** - Action that modifies state and is processed by reducers.

**Effectful Action** - Action that triggers side effects (service calls) and is processed by effects.

### State Management Terms

**Substate** - Abstraction that gives components access to their specific portion of global state without coupling to global state structure.

**Dispatcher** - Interface for dispatching new actions from within reducers.

**Callback** - Mechanism for components to respond to async operations without tight coupling.

**bug_condition!** - Macro for defensive programming that marks code paths that should be unreachable if enabling conditions work correctly.

### Service Architecture Terms

**Service** - Component that handles external I/O, heavy computation, or async operations. Runs in separate threads.

**Event** - Result from a service operation that gets converted to an action and fed back to the state machine.

**EventSource** - Central service that aggregates events from all other services and forwards them to the state machine.

**Deterministic Execution** - Principle that given the same inputs, the system behaves identically. Achieved by isolating non-determinism to services.

### Development Terms

**New Style** - Current architecture pattern with unified reducers that handle both state updates and action dispatching.

**Old Style** - Legacy architecture pattern with separate reducer and effects files. Still used in transition frontier. For migration instructions, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](../../ARCHITECTURE.md).

**Component** - Self-contained state machine handling a specific domain (e.g., transaction pool, P2P networking).

**Summary.md** - File in each component directory documenting purpose, technical debt, and implementation notes.

**ActionEvent** - Derive macro that generates structured logging for actions.

### Network and Protocol Terms

**Network Configuration** - System supporting multiple networks (devnet/mainnet) with different parameters.

**OCaml Compatibility** - Many components are direct ports from the OCaml Mina implementation.

**P2P** - Peer-to-peer networking layer using libp2p with custom WebRTC transport.

**SNARK** - Zero-knowledge proof system used for blockchain verification.

**Ledger** - Blockchain account state management system.

**Transition Frontier** - Core consensus and blockchain state management component.

### Testing Terms

**Scenario** - Structured test case that can be recorded, saved, and replayed deterministically.

**Recording/Replay** - System for capturing execution traces and replaying them exactly for debugging.

**Differential Testing** - Comparing OpenMina behavior against the OCaml implementation.

**Fuzzing** - Automated testing with random inputs to find edge cases.

## Key Concepts to Understand

Before diving into the documentation, familiarize yourself with these core concepts:

1. **Redux Pattern** - State management through actions and reducers
2. **Deterministic Execution** - Separation of pure state logic from side effects
3. **Network Configuration** - Support for multiple networks (devnet/mainnet) with different parameters
4. **OCaml Compatibility** - Many components are direct ports from the OCaml implementation
5. **Service Architecture** - External interactions handled by services, not state machines
