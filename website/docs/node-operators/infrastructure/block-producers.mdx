# Block Producers

o1Labs maintains block producer node infrastructure that actively participates
in the Mina Rust network consensus. These nodes provide HTTP endpoints for
network interaction.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

:::info Block Production Under Development

Block production functionality is currently under development and pending
testing and release. These nodes currently operate as network participants with
GraphQL API access.

## Available Block Producer Nodes

The following block producer nodes are officially maintained by o1Labs:

<CodeBlock
  language="text"
  title="website/docs/developers/scripts/infrastructure/block-producer-nodes.txt"
>
  {BlockProducerNodesList}
</CodeBlock>

## Node Information

- **Availability**: Maintained 24/7 by o1Labs
- **Purpose**: Network consensus participation (block production under
  development)
- **Location**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- **Additional Features**: GraphQL API access for network queries

## Using Block Producer Nodes

### Latest canonical block information

Query the latest canonical block to get block height, state hash, and block
creator:

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  title="website/docs/developers/scripts/infrastructure/query-best-chain-block.sh"
>
  {QueryBestChainBlock}
</CodeBlock>

### Transaction information

Check transactions in the latest block:

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  title="website/docs/developers/scripts/infrastructure/query-best-chain-transactions.sh"
>
  {QueryBestChainTransactions}
</CodeBlock>

## API Capabilities

### Blockchain Queries

- **Block information**: Current and historical blocks
- **Transaction data**: Transaction status and history
- **Account balances**: Account information and balances
- **Network state**: Consensus and sync status

### Network Monitoring

- **Peer connections**: Current peer list and status
- **Sync progress**: Blockchain synchronization state
- **Protocol information**: Network protocol version and chain ID

:::info API Documentation

For complete API documentation, see the
[GraphQL API](../../developers/graphql-api) documentation which provides
detailed information about available queries and mutations.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

If you cannot connect to block producer nodes:

1. **Check network connectivity**: Ensure internet access and HTTPS traffic is
   allowed
2. **Verify URLs**: Confirm you're using the correct node URLs
3. **Test manually**: Try accessing the URLs in a browser
4. **Check node status**: Verify the node is responding to queries

### API Errors

Common API issues:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

:::caution GraphQL Endpoint URL Format

When using block producer node endpoints, **always include `/graphql` at the end
of the URL**. The endpoint will return "HTTP method not allowed" if you omit the
`/graphql` path.

**Correct**: `https://mina-rust-bp-1.gcp.o1test.net/graphql`

**Incorrect**: `https://mina-rust-bp-1.gcp.o1test.net/`

o1Labs uses [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/) to maintain the
infrastructure through GitOps.

To update the block producer nodes infrastructure:

1. Access the private repository:
   `https://github.com/o1-labs/gitops-infrastructure`
2. Create a new branch for your changes
3. Edit: `applications/auto-deployed/mina-rust-standard-bps.yaml`
4. Update the `MINA_RUST_TAG` variable to the desired commit or release tag
   (must be available as a Docker image on
   [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/o1labs/mina-rust))
5. Create a pull request with your changes
6. Ask the platform lead or rust node team lead to review and merge the PR
7. Once merged, ArgoCD will automatically deploy the update
