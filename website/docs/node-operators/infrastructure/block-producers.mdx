# Block Producers

o1Labs maintains block producer node infrastructure that actively participates
in the Mina Rust network consensus. These nodes produce blocks and help secure
the network while also providing HTTP endpoints for network interaction.

## Available Block Producer Nodes

The following block producer nodes are officially maintained by o1Labs:

<CodeBlock
  language="text"
  title="website/docs/developers/scripts/infrastructure/block-producer-nodes.txt"
>
  {BlockProducerNodesList}
</CodeBlock>

## Node Information

- **Availability**: Maintained 24/7 by o1Labs
- **Purpose**: Block production and network consensus participation
- **Location**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- **Additional Features**: GraphQL API access for network queries

## Using Block Producer Nodes

### GraphQL API Access

Block producer nodes provide GraphQL API endpoints for querying network state:

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  title="website/docs/developers/scripts/infrastructure/query-daemon-status.sh"
>
  {QueryDaemonStatus}
</CodeBlock>

### Network Information

You can query various network information:

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  title="website/docs/developers/scripts/infrastructure/query-block-height.sh"
>
  {QueryBlockHeight}
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  title="website/docs/developers/scripts/infrastructure/query-peers.sh"
>
  {QueryPeers}
</CodeBlock>

## API Capabilities

### Blockchain Queries

- **Block information**: Current and historical blocks
- **Transaction data**: Transaction status and history
- **Account balances**: Account information and balances
- **Network state**: Consensus and sync status

### Network Monitoring

- **Peer connections**: Current peer list and status
- **Sync progress**: Blockchain synchronization state
- **Protocol information**: Network protocol version and chain ID

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

If you cannot connect to block producer nodes:

1. **Check network connectivity**: Ensure internet access and HTTPS traffic is
   allowed
2. **Verify URLs**: Confirm you're using the correct node URLs
3. **Test manually**: Try accessing the URLs in a browser
4. **Check node status**: Verify the node is responding to queries

### API Errors

Common API issues:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

:::caution GraphQL Endpoint URL Format

When using block producer node endpoints, **always include `/graphql` at the end
of the URL**. The endpoint will return "HTTP method not allowed" if you omit the
`/graphql` path.

**Correct**: `https://mina-rust-bp-1.gcp.o1test.net/graphql`

**Incorrect**: `https://mina-rust-bp-1.gcp.o1test.net/`

## Updates and Maintenance

### Infrastructure Updates

o1Labs maintains these block producer nodes with:

- **Regular updates**: Nodes are kept current with latest releases
- **Monitoring**: 24/7 health monitoring and alerting
- **Load balancing**: Multiple nodes ensure continuous availability
- **Performance optimization**: Regular performance tuning

### Communication

Infrastructure maintenance and updates are communicated through:

- GitHub release notes
- Project documentation updates
- Community announcements

o1Labs uses [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/) to maintain the
infrastructure through GitOps.

To update the block producer nodes infrastructure:

1. Access the private repository:
   `https://github.com/o1-labs/gitops-infrastructure`
2. Create a new branch for your changes
3. Edit: `applications/auto-deployed/mina-rust-standard-bps.yaml`
4. Update the `MINA_RUST_TAG` variable to the desired commit or release tag
   (must be available as a Docker image on
   [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/o1labs/mina-rust))
5. Create a pull request with your changes
6. Ask the platform lead or rust node team lead to review and merge the PR
7. Once merged, ArgoCD will automatically deploy the update
