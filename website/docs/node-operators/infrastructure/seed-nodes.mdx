# Seed Nodes

o1Labs maintains official seed nodes that provide reliable entry points for
connecting to the Mina Rust network. These nodes are recommended for use by node
operators who want to ensure stable connectivity.

## Available Seed Nodes

The following seed nodes are officially maintained by o1Labs:

:::info Connectivity Testing

These seed nodes are tested automatically by CI to ensure they remain
accessible. If you experience connectivity issues, please check the project's
GitHub Issues page for any known outages.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

If you cannot connect to seed nodes:

1. **Check network connectivity**: Ensure internet access and DNS resolution
2. **Verify firewall settings**: Allow outbound HTTPS connections
3. **Test manually**: Try `curl https://mina-rust-seed-1.gcp.o1test.net`
4. **Check node logs**: Look for connection error messages

### DNS Resolution Problems

```bash
# Test DNS resolution
nslookup mina-rust-seed-1.gcp.o1test.net

# Alternative DNS servers
nslookup mina-rust-seed-1.gcp.o1test.net 8.8.8.8
```

### Certificate Issues

If you encounter TLS/SSL certificate problems:

```bash
# Test certificate validity
openssl s_client -connect mina-rust-seed-1.gcp.o1test.net:443 \
  -servername mina-rust-seed-1.gcp.o1test.net
```
