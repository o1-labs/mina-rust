# Seed Nodes

o1Labs maintains official seed nodes that provide reliable entry points for
connecting to the Mina Rust network. These nodes are recommended for use by node
operators who want to ensure stable connectivity.

## Available Seed Nodes

The following seed nodes are officially maintained by o1Labs:

  {SeedNodesList}
</CodeBlock>

## Configuration

For information on how to configure your node to use these seed nodes, see the
[Network Configuration](../network-configuration) page.

:::info Connectivity Testing

These seed nodes are tested automatically by CI to ensure they remain
accessible. If you experience connectivity issues, please check the project's
GitHub Issues page for any known outages.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

If you cannot connect to seed nodes:

1. **Check network connectivity**: Ensure internet access and DNS resolution
2. **Verify firewall settings**: Allow outbound HTTPS connections
3. **Test manually**: Try `curl https://mina-rust-seed-1.gcp.o1test.net`
4. **Check node logs**: Look for connection error messages

### DNS Resolution Problems

```bash
# Test DNS resolution
nslookup mina-rust-seed-1.gcp.o1test.net

# Alternative DNS servers
nslookup mina-rust-seed-1.gcp.o1test.net 8.8.8.8
```

### Certificate Issues

If you encounter TLS/SSL certificate problems:

```bash
# Test certificate validity
openssl s_client -connect mina-rust-seed-1.gcp.o1test.net:443 \
  -servername mina-rust-seed-1.gcp.o1test.net
```

o1Labs uses [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/) to maintain the
infrastructure through GitOps.

To update the seed nodes infrastructure:

1. Access the private repository:
   `https://github.com/o1-labs/gitops-infrastructure`
2. Create a new branch for your changes
3. Edit: `applications/auto-deployed/mina-rust-standard-seeds.yaml`
4. Update the `MINA_RUST_TAG` variable to the desired commit or release tag
   (must be available as a Docker image on
   [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/o1labs/mina-rust))
5. Create a pull request with your changes
6. Ask the platform lead or rust node team lead to review and merge the PR
7. Once merged, ArgoCD will automatically deploy the update
