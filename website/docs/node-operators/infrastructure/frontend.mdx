# Frontend

The o1Labs frontend infrastructure provides web-based interfaces for interacting
with the Mina network. This infrastructure is divided into two main components.

## Node Dashboard

The Node Dashboard provides real-time monitoring and visualization of Mina
network nodes. o1Labs operates a production instance that connects to the devnet
infrastructure.

### Production Instance

- **URL**: https://mina-rust-node-dashboard.minaprotocol.com
- **Environment**: Production
- **Network**: Mina Devnet
- **Infrastructure**: o1Labs plain nodes

For development and technical information about the Node Dashboard, refer to the
[node dashboard developer documentation](../../developers/frontend/node-dashboard.mdx).

### Deployment (o1Labs employees only)

o1Labs uses [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/) to maintain the
infrastructure through GitOps.

To update the Node Dashboard deployment:

1. Access the private repository:
   `https://github.com/o1-labs/gitops-infrastructure`
2. Create a new branch for your changes
3. Edit: `applications/auto-deployed/mina-rust-standard-dashboard.yaml`
4. Update the `MINA_RUST_TAG` variable to the desired commit or release tag
   (must be available as a Docker image on
   [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/o1labs/mina-rust-frontend))
5. Create a pull request with your changes
6. Ask the platform lead or rust node team lead to review and merge the PR
7. Once merged, ArgoCD will automatically deploy the update

## WebNode

This section is still a work in progress. For information about the WebNode,
refer to the developers documentation of the
[web node](../../developers/frontend/webnode.mdx).
