# Join devnet

The Mina Protocol devnet is an existing testing network where OCaml nodes are
currently running. Community members can join this network with the Rust node
implementation to test interoperability and contribute to improving the Rust
node implementation. By joining devnet, you'll gain experience with the Mina
Rust node while helping validate the Rust implementation.

## Getting started

Follow these steps to join the devnet program:

### 1. Join the Discord

Connect with the Mina community and devnet participants:

- **Channel**: #devnet
- **Invite link**: https://discord.gg/minaprotocol

We recommend introducing yourself in the channel and joining the testing
channels:

- #rust-node-testing
- #rust-node-questions-and-feedback

### 2. Obtain devnet test tokens

Get test tokens to start participating in the network:

- **Faucet**: https://faucet.minaprotocol.com/

The faucet provides tokens for general testing purposes.

### 3. Set up your node

Install and configure your Mina Rust node:

- Follow the [Getting Started guide](getting-started) to install your node
- Refer to [Node Operations](block-producer) for configuration options
- Visit the official documentation: https://docs.minaprotocol.com/

### 4. Block producer testing (optional)

If you want to test block production and need a larger amount of devnet test
tokens:

Contact the devnet coordinators on Discord:

- **CrisF**: Discord ID `412482228359266328`
- **JohnR**: Discord ID `686750097660444716`

They can provide additional tokens and guidance for block producer testing.

## Next steps

Once you've joined the devnet:

1. Set up your node following the [Block Producer guide](block-producer)
2. Set up the [node dashboard](../developers/frontend/node-dashboard) to monitor
   the next blocks you will produce, your node's state, and performance metrics
3. Share feedback and report issues in the testing channels
4. Participate in testing activities and network experiments
5. Stay updated: The o1Labs team makes regular updates to the node. Check for
   updates frequently and keep your node up to date

## Getting help
