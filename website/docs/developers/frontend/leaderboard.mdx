# Leaderboard

The Leaderboard is a specialized frontend application designed to track and rank
community participation in Mina Rust node testnets. It provides real-time
visibility into testnet contributions, encouraging healthy competition among
participants.

## Overview

The Leaderboard system was developed to monitor testnet participation metrics
and provide transparent rankings of community members based on their
contributions to network stability, block production, and overall testnet
health.

## Configuration

### Building for Leaderboard

Build the Leaderboard-specific version:

```bash
cd frontend

# Build with leaderboard configuration
make build-production

# Copy leaderboard environment
cp dist/frontend/browser/assets/environments/leaderboard.js \
   dist/frontend/browser/assets/environments/env.js
```

## Deployment

### Firebase Deployment

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

:::caution Outdated Configuration

The Firebase deployment configuration may be outdated. Please verify the current
deployment targets and update the configuration as needed before deploying to
production.

:::

<!-- prettier-ignore-stop -->

Deploy the Leaderboard to Firebase hosting:

```bash
# Deploy leaderboard variant
make deploy-leaderboard
```

This command will:

1. Run prebuild to update version
2. Build production assets with Sentry integration
3. Configure leaderboard-specific environment
4. Deploy to Firebase hosting

### Standalone Deployment

For custom hosting solutions:

```bash
# Build the application
make build-production

# Configure for leaderboard
cp dist/frontend/browser/assets/environments/leaderboard.js \
   dist/frontend/browser/assets/environments/env.js

# Serve the static files
npx http-server dist/frontend/browser -p 8080
```

## Docker deployment

The Leaderboard can be deployed using Docker.

### Environment configuration

The Leaderboard uses the `leaderboard` environment configuration which:

- **Community participation tracking** - Optimized for monitoring testnet
  contributions and rankings
- **Real-time metrics** - Provides live updates of participant performance and
  network statistics
- **Leaderboard APIs** - Connects to specialized endpoints for ranking and
  participation data
- **Analytics enabled** - Includes detailed participation tracking and usage
  analytics

### Build Docker image

```bash
# Generate .env.docker with current git information (required for WASM build)
frontend/docker/generate-docker-env.sh

# Build the Docker image (from project root)
docker build -t mina-frontend -f frontend/Dockerfile .
```

### Run with Docker

```bash
# Run Leaderboard with leaderboard configuration
docker run -p 4200:80 -e MINA_FRONTEND_ENVIRONMENT=leaderboard mina-frontend
```

### Docker Compose

Use the provided docker-compose configuration for easier management:

```bash
# Start Leaderboard
docker-compose -f docker-compose.frontend.yml up frontend-leaderboard
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

:::info Docker Build Process

The Docker image builds the frontend **at container startup** based on the
`MINA_FRONTEND_ENVIRONMENT` variable. For the Leaderboard, use `production`
environment.
