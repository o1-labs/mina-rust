# Leaderboard

The Leaderboard is a specialized frontend application designed to track and rank
community participation in Mina Rust node testnets. It provides real-time
visibility into testnet contributions, encouraging healthy competition among
participants.

## Overview

The Leaderboard system was developed to monitor testnet participation metrics
and provide transparent rankings of community members based on their
contributions to network stability, block production, and overall testnet
health.

## Configuration

### Building for Leaderboard

Build the Leaderboard-specific version:

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="scripts/frontend/build-leaderboard.sh">
  {BuildLeaderboard}
</CodeBlock>

## Deployment

### Firebase Deployment

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

:::caution Outdated Configuration

The Firebase deployment configuration may be outdated. Please verify the current
deployment targets and update the configuration as needed before deploying to
production.

Deploy the Leaderboard to Firebase hosting:

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="scripts/frontend/deploy-leaderboard.sh">
  {DeployLeaderboard}
</CodeBlock>

This command will:

1. Run prebuild to update version
2. Build production assets with Sentry integration
3. Configure leaderboard-specific environment
4. Deploy to Firebase hosting

### Standalone Deployment

For custom hosting solutions:

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="scripts/frontend/serve-leaderboard.sh">
  {ServeLeaderboard}
</CodeBlock>

## Docker deployment

The Leaderboard can be deployed using Docker.

### Environment configuration

The Leaderboard uses the `leaderboard` environment configuration which:

- **Community participation tracking** - Optimized for monitoring testnet
  contributions and rankings
- **Real-time metrics** - Provides live updates of participant performance and
  network statistics
- **Leaderboard APIs** - Connects to specialized endpoints for ranking and
  participation data
- **Analytics enabled** - Includes detailed participation tracking and usage
  analytics

### Build Docker image

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="scripts/frontend/docker-build-leaderboard.sh">
  {DockerBuildLeaderboard}
</CodeBlock>

### Run with Docker

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="scripts/frontend/docker-run-leaderboard.sh">
  {DockerRunLeaderboard}
</CodeBlock>

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

:::info Docker Build Process

The Docker image builds the frontend **at container startup** based on the
`MINA_FRONTEND_ENVIRONMENT` variable. For the Leaderboard, use `production`
environment.
