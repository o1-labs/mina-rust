# Node Dashboard

The Node Dashboard is a comprehensive web interface for monitoring and
interacting with your Mina Rust node. Built with Angular, it provides real-time
insights into your node's operation and the broader network state.

## Features

- **Real-time node monitoring** - View node status, blockchain state, and
  network activity
- **Block explorer** - Browse blocks, transactions, and accounts
- **Network visualization** - See peer connections and network topology
- **SNARK worker monitoring** - Track SNARK work production and verification
- **Transaction pool viewer** - Monitor pending transactions
- **Performance metrics** - Resource usage and performance dashboards

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and Angular CLI installed by following the
[Frontend Prerequisites](./#prerequisites) guide.

## Quick start

### Installation

Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="scripts/frontend/install-dependencies.sh">
  {InstallDependencies}
</CodeBlock>

### Development server

Start the development server with hot-reload:

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="scripts/frontend/start-development.sh">
  {StartDevelopment}
</CodeBlock>

This will:

1. Install any missing dependencies
2. Start the Angular development server
3. Open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:4200`

## Build configurations

The frontend supports multiple build configurations for different environments:

### Development builds

For local development with debugging features:

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="scripts/frontend/build-development.sh">
  {BuildDevelopment}
</CodeBlock>

Other development configurations:

```bash
# Local configuration (connects to local node)
make build-local

# Mobile-accessible development server
make start-dev-mobile
```

### Production builds

For optimized production deployments:

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="scripts/frontend/build-production.sh">
  {BuildProduction}
</CodeBlock>

Production build with Sentry error tracking:

```bash
make build-prod-sentry
```

### Specialized configurations

```bash
# Block producer dashboard
make build-producer

# Fuzzing test interface
make build-fuzzing

# WebNode integration
make build-webnodelocal
```

## Configuration

### Environment files

The frontend uses environment-specific configuration files located in
`src/assets/environments/`:

- [`development.js`](https://github.com/o1-labs/mina-rust-2/blob/develop/frontend/src/assets/environments/development.js) -
  Development servers
- [`fuzzing.js`](https://github.com/o1-labs/mina-rust-2/blob/develop/frontend/src/assets/environments/fuzzing.js) -
  Fuzzing tests
- [`local.js`](https://github.com/o1-labs/mina-rust-2/blob/develop/frontend/src/assets/environments/local.js) -
  Local development
- [`producer.js`](https://github.com/o1-labs/mina-rust-2/blob/develop/frontend/src/assets/environments/producer.js) -
  Block producer interface
- [`production.js`](https://github.com/o1-labs/mina-rust-2/blob/develop/frontend/src/assets/environments/production.js) -
  Production deployment
- [`webnode.js`](https://github.com/o1-labs/mina-rust-2/blob/develop/frontend/src/assets/environments/webnode.js) -
  WebNode integration

For the most current environment configuration files, see the
[frontend/src/assets/environments](https://github.com/o1-labs/mina-rust-2/tree/develop/frontend/src/assets/environments)
directory in the develop branch.

## Development workflow

### Code formatting

The project uses Prettier for consistent code formatting:

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="scripts/frontend/format-code.sh">
  {FormatCode}
</CodeBlock>

### Testing

Run the Cypress test suite:

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="scripts/frontend/run-tests.sh">
  {RunTests}
</CodeBlock>

For interactive testing:

```bash
# Interactive test runner
make test
```

### Building for production

Create an optimized production build:

```bash
# Build with version update
make prebuild
make build-prod

# Build with Sentry sourcemaps
make build-prod-sentry
```

### Serving production builds

Test production builds locally:

```bash
make build-prod
make start-bundle
```

## Features

### Real-time updates

The frontend maintains WebSocket connections for real-time updates:

- Block production events
- Network peer changes
- Transaction pool updates
- SNARK work completion
