# Node Dashboard

The Node Dashboard is a comprehensive web interface for monitoring and
interacting with your Mina Rust node. Built with Angular, it provides real-time
insights into your node's operation and the broader network state.

## Features

- **Real-time node monitoring** - View node status, blockchain state, and
  network activity
- **Block explorer** - Browse blocks, transactions, and accounts
- **Network visualization** - See peer connections and network topology
- **SNARK worker monitoring** - Track SNARK work production and verification
- **Transaction pool viewer** - Monitor pending transactions
- **Performance metrics** - Resource usage and performance dashboards

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and Angular CLI installed by following the
[Frontend Prerequisites](./#prerequisites) guide.

## Quick start

### Installation

Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="scripts/frontend/install-dependencies.sh">
  {InstallDependencies}
</CodeBlock>

### Development server

Start the development server with hot-reload:

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="scripts/frontend/start-development.sh">
  {StartDevelopment}
</CodeBlock>

This will:

1. Install any missing dependencies
2. Start the Angular development server
3. Open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:4200`

## Build configurations

The frontend supports multiple build configurations for different environments:

```bash
# Local configuration (connects to local node)
make build-local

# Mobile-accessible development server
make start-dev-mobile
```

### Production builds

For optimized production deployments:

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="scripts/frontend/build-production.sh">
  {BuildProduction}
</CodeBlock>

Production build with Sentry error tracking:

```bash
make build-production-sentry
```

### Specialized configurations

```bash
# Block producer dashboard
make build-producer

# Fuzzing test interface
make build-fuzzing

# WebNode integration
make build-webnode
```

## Configuration

### Environment files

The frontend uses environment-specific configuration files located in
`src/assets/environments/`:

- [`fuzzing.js`](https://github.com/o1-labs/mina-rust/blob/develop/frontend/src/assets/environments/fuzzing.js) -
  Fuzzing tests
- [`local.js`](https://github.com/o1-labs/mina-rust/blob/develop/frontend/src/assets/environments/local.js) -
  Local development
- [`producer.js`](https://github.com/o1-labs/mina-rust/blob/develop/frontend/src/assets/environments/producer.js) -
  Block producer interface
- [`production.js`](https://github.com/o1-labs/mina-rust/blob/develop/frontend/src/assets/environments/production.js) -
  Production deployment
- [`webnode.js`](https://github.com/o1-labs/mina-rust/blob/develop/frontend/src/assets/environments/webnode.js) -
  WebNode integration

For the most current environment configuration files, see the
[frontend/src/assets/environments](https://github.com/o1-labs/mina-rust/tree/develop/frontend/src/assets/environments)
directory in the develop branch.

## Development workflow

### Code formatting

The project uses Prettier for consistent code formatting:

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="scripts/frontend/format-code.sh">
  {FormatCode}
</CodeBlock>

### Testing

Run the Cypress test suite:

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="scripts/frontend/run-tests.sh">
  {RunTests}
</CodeBlock>

For interactive testing:

```bash
# Interactive test runner
make test
```

### Building for production

Create an optimized production build:

```bash
# Build with version update
make prebuild
make build-production

# Build with Sentry sourcemaps
make build-production-sentry
```

### Serving production builds

Test production builds locally:

```bash
make build-production
make start-bundle
```

## Docker deployment

The Node Dashboard can be deployed using Docker with environment-specific
builds.

### Environment configurations

The `MINA_FRONTEND_ENVIRONMENT` variable determines how the frontend is built
and configured:

- **`local`** - Local development environment connecting to localhost:3085.
  Optimized for development with a local node instance.

- **`fuzzing`** - Fuzzing test environment for stress testing. Development build
  with enhanced debugging for testing scenarios.

- **`prod`** - Production environment with full optimization. Connects to
  production network endpoints with minification and performance optimizations.

- **`producer`** - Specialized configuration for block producers. Includes
  additional monitoring and producer-specific features.

- **`webnodelocal`** - WebNode configuration for browser-based Mina node
  operation. Enables WASM integration and WebRTC networking for in-browser
  execution.

- **`leaderboard`** - Leaderboard configuration for community participation
  tracking. Optimized for testnet participation metrics and rankings.

### Build Docker image

```bash
# Generate .env.docker with current git information (required for WASM build)
frontend/docker/generate-docker-env.sh

# Build the Docker image (from project root)
docker build -t mina-frontend -f frontend/Dockerfile .
```

### Run with Docker

```bash
# Run Node Dashboard with local configuration (connects to localhost:3085)
docker run -p 4200:80 -e MINA_FRONTEND_ENVIRONMENT=local mina-frontend

# Run Node Dashboard with production configuration (production endpoints)
docker run -p 4200:80 -e MINA_FRONTEND_ENVIRONMENT=production mina-frontend

# Run Node Dashboard with webnode configuration (browser-based node operation)
docker run -p 4200:80 -e MINA_FRONTEND_ENVIRONMENT=webnodelocal mina-frontend

# Run Node Dashboard with producer configuration (block producer features)
docker run -p 4200:80 -e MINA_FRONTEND_ENVIRONMENT=producer mina-frontend

# Run Node Dashboard with fuzzing configuration (stress testing)
docker run -p 4200:80 -e MINA_FRONTEND_ENVIRONMENT=fuzzing mina-frontend

# Run Node Dashboard with leaderboard configuration (community tracking)
docker run -p 4200:80 -e MINA_FRONTEND_ENVIRONMENT=leaderboard mina-frontend
```

:::info Docker Build Process

The Docker image builds the frontend **at container startup** based on the
`MINA_FRONTEND_ENVIRONMENT` variable. This allows a single Docker image to serve
different configurations.
