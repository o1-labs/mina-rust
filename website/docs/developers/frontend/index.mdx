# Frontend Applications

The Mina Rust node ecosystem includes several web-based frontend applications,
each serving a specific purpose in the network.

## Components

### [Node Dashboard](./node-dashboard)

A comprehensive web interface for monitoring and interacting with your Mina Rust
node. View real-time blockchain state, network activity, and node metrics
through an intuitive dashboard.

### [Leaderboard](./leaderboard)

Track community participation in testnets with a competitive leaderboard system.
Previously used to monitor and rank testnet participants based on their
contributions to network stability and block production.

### [WebNode](./webnode)

Run a Mina node directly in your web browser using WebAssembly. This
experimental feature enables block production without installing native
software, pushing the boundaries of decentralized infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

All frontend applications are built with Angular and require Node.js to be
installed.

<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="scripts/frontend/install-nodejs-linux.sh">
  {InstallNodejsLinux}
</CodeBlock>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="scripts/frontend/install-nodejs-macos.sh">
  {InstallNodejsMacos}
</CodeBlock>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Install Angular CLI

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="scripts/frontend/install-angular-cli.sh">
  {InstallAngularCli}
</CodeBlock>

## Environment configurations

The frontend applications support multiple environment configurations that
determine network endpoints, build optimizations, and feature sets:

### Available environments

- **`local`** - Development configuration for local node testing
  - Connects to `localhost:3085` for GraphQL API
  - Debug features enabled

- **`production`** - Production network configuration
  - Connects to mainnet or production endpoints
  - Fully optimized builds with minification
  - Error reporting and analytics enabled

- **`producer`** - Block producer specialized configuration
  - Additional monitoring dashboards
  - Producer-specific metrics and tools
  - Enhanced performance monitoring

- **`webnode`** - WebAssembly node configuration
  - Enables WebRTC peer-to-peer networking
  - Integrates with browser-based WASM node
  - Automatic circuit file management
  - Optimized for in-browser execution

- **`fuzzing`** - Testing and fuzzing configuration
  - Special build for automated testing
  - Enhanced test instrumentation
  - Mock data and test endpoints

### Using environments

Environments are specified during build:

```bash
# Local development
make build-local

# Production deployment
make build-production

# WebNode deployment
make build-webnode
```

Or via Docker:

```bash
# Specify environment at runtime (REQUIRED)
docker run -p 4200:80 -e MINA_FRONTEND_ENVIRONMENT=local mina-frontend
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

:::warning Environment Variable Required

The `MINA_FRONTEND_ENVIRONMENT` variable is **mandatory** when running the
Docker container. The container will exit with an error if this variable is not
set.

## Next Steps

With Node.js and Angular CLI installed, you're ready to build and run any of the
frontend applications. Select a component above to learn about its specific
features and configuration.
