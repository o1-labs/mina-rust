# Docker Installation Guide

## Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

The following commands are tested on Ubuntu 22.04 and Ubuntu 24.04 in our CI
pipeline:

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import DockerInstallLinux from "!!raw-loader!../developers/scripts/setup/install-docker.sh";

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="install-docker.sh">
  {DockerInstallLinux}
</CodeBlock>

After installation, you'll need to either log out and back in, or use
`newgrp docker` to apply the group membership.

## macOS

The following commands are tested on macOS in our CI pipeline:

import DockerInstallMacOS from "!!raw-loader!../developers/scripts/setup/install-docker-macos.sh";

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="install-docker-macos.sh">
  {DockerInstallMacOS}
</CodeBlock>

**Note**: After installation, you need to manually start Docker Desktop from
Applications or Launchpad.

## Windows

For Windows, manually download and install
[Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

## Manual Verification

After installation, verify Docker is working:

```bash
docker --version
docker run hello-world
```

## Alternative Manual Installation

If you prefer not to use the automated scripts, you can find manual installation
instructions in Docker's official documentation:

- [Docker on Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
- [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/)
- [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/)

## Testing

These installation scripts are tested nightly and on-demand in our CI pipeline
to ensure they remain functional across different environments. You can see the
test results in the
[Documentation Scripts workflow](https://github.com/o1-labs/mina-rust/actions/workflows/test-docs-scripts.yaml).
