# Getting Started with OpenMina

Welcome to OpenMina, a Rust implementation of the Mina Protocol - a lightweight
blockchain using zero-knowledge proofs.

## What is OpenMina?

OpenMina provides an alternative implementation of the Mina Protocol node,
written in Rust for improved performance, security, and reliability. Whether
you're looking to run a block producer, archive node, or participate in the
devnet, this guide will help you get started.

## Prerequisites

Before running an OpenMina node, ensure you have:

- **Operating System**: Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+, Debian 10+) or macOS
- **Memory**: At least 8GB RAM (16GB recommended for block producers)
- **Storage**: 50GB+ free disk space
- **Network**: Stable internet connection with open ports

## Installation Options

Choose your preferred installation method:

### 1. Docker Installation (Recommended)

Docker provides the easiest way to get started with OpenMina.

## Node Types

OpenMina supports different node configurations:

- **[Block Producer](block-producer)** - Participate in consensus and produce
  blocks
- **[Archive Node](archive-node)** - Store and serve complete blockchain history

## Next Steps

1. Choose your installation method
2. Select the appropriate node type for your needs
3. Follow the setup guide for your chosen configuration
4. Join the devnet to start participating
