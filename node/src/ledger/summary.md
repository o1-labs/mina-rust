# Ledger State Machine

Manages the blockchain's account ledger, balances, and ledger synchronization through coordinated read/write operations.

## Purpose
- Maintains account states and balances in snarked and staged ledgers
- Applies transactions and blocks to update ledger state
- Provides merkle proofs and account lookups for various consumers
- Manages ledger synchronization with isolated sync state
- Tracks mask lifecycle and prevents memory leaks

## Key Components
- **Read Substate**: Cost-limited concurrent ledger queries with request deduplication
- **Write Substate**: Sequential ledger operations (block apply, diff creation, reconstruction, commits)
- **LedgerManager**: Thread-based service that handles actual ledger operations asynchronously
- **Sync State**: Separate ledger storage for synchronization operations
- **Archive Support**: Additional data collection for archive nodes

## Service Architecture
- **LedgerManager**: Spawns dedicated "ledger-manager" thread with message passing interface
- **Request Types**: Unified request enum covering read/write operations, account management, and sync operations
- **Async/Sync Modes**: Supports both fire-and-forget calls and synchronous blocking calls
- **State Machine Integration**: Routes responses back through event system to update state machines

## Storage Architecture
- **Snarked Ledgers**: Finalized ledger states indexed by merkle root hash (includes disk-loaded ledgers)
- **Staged Ledgers**: Working ledgers with pending transactions, indexed by staged ledger hash
- **Sync Ledgers**: Temporary storage during ledger synchronization

## Interactions
- **Transition Frontier**: Block application and synchronization coordination
- **Block Producer**: Staged ledger diff creation for new blocks
- **RPC/P2P**: Account queries, ledger sync, and proof generation
- **VRF Evaluator**: Delegator table construction for consensus

## Technical Debt

The ledger implementation has several areas of technical debt:

### Code Organization
- **Large service files**: LedgerManager and LedgerService are complex and need simplification/reorganization
- **Documentation gaps**: Core components like LedgerCtx need better documentation of their responsibilities

### Integration and Testing Issues  
- **Heavy coupling**: Deep integration with transition frontier, block producer, and P2P makes isolated testing difficult
- **Mask leak detection**: Unreliable during testing scenarios (alive_masks tracking)
- **Threading complexity**: Staged ledger reconstruction spawns additional threads with callback patterns
- **Ad-hoc threading**: Manual thread spawning for reconstruction instead of async patterns
- **Workaround patterns**: TODO comments about making services async to remove threading workarounds

### Error Handling and Reliability
- **Inconsistent error handling**: Mix of panics, unwraps, and proper error propagation throughout
- **Type safety gaps**: Request/response relationships "can't be expressed in the Rust type system"
- **Debugging infrastructure**: Specialized dump-to-file functions suggest frequent debugging needs
- **Hash mismatch handling**: Panics on staged ledger hash mismatches instead of graceful recovery
- **Silent failures**: Some operations like commit fail silently with TODO comments questioning this behavior

### Configuration Issues
- **Hardcoded constants**: Ledger depth tied to mainnet constants - will break if networks use different depths
