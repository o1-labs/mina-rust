# Block Producer State Machine

Orchestrates the complete block production pipeline from VRF evaluation to proof generation and network broadcast.

## Purpose
- **Block Production Pipeline**: Coordinates the multi-phase process of creating, proving, and broadcasting blocks
- **VRF Integration**: Uses VRF evaluator subcomponent to determine slot leadership eligibility
- **Transaction Selection**: Retrieves and includes transactions from the transaction pool based on fee priority
- **Proof Coordination**: Requests block proofs from external SNARK services and handles proof completion
- **Network Broadcasting**: Injects completed blocks into the P2P network via transition frontier

## Architecture

### State Structure
- **BlockProducerState**: Optional wrapper enabling/disabling block production
- **BlockProducerEnabled**: Active state containing configuration, VRF evaluator, current state, and injected block tracking
- **VRF Evaluator**: Subcomponent handling slot leadership determination (see `vrf_evaluator/summary.md`)
- **Injected Blocks Tracking**: `BTreeSet<StateHash>` maintaining blocks pending best tip transitions

### Multi-Phase Block Production State Flow
```
Idle → WonSlot → WonSlotWait → WonSlotProduceInit → 
WonSlotTransactionsGet → WonSlotTransactionsSuccess → 
StagedLedgerDiffCreatePending → StagedLedgerDiffCreateSuccess → 
BlockUnprovenBuilt → BlockProvePending → BlockProveSuccess → 
BlockProduced → BlockInjected → Idle
```

### Action Types
- **VRF Actions**: `VrfEvaluator(BlockProducerVrfEvaluatorAction)` for slot leadership
- **Timing Actions**: `WonSlotSearch`, `WonSlot`, `WonSlotWait` for slot coordination
- **Transaction Actions**: `WonSlotTransactionsGet/Success` for mempool integration
- **Ledger Actions**: `StagedLedgerDiffCreate*` for state transition construction
- **Proof Actions**: `BlockProve*` for external SNARK proof coordination
- **Network Actions**: `BlockInject/Injected` for P2P broadcast

## Key Algorithms

### Block Production Coordination
1. **VRF Evaluation**: Delegates to VRF evaluator subcomponent for slot wins
2. **Transaction Collection**: Requests transactions from pool sorted by fee
3. **Staged Ledger Diff**: Creates valid state transitions including coinbase and fees
4. **Block Construction**: Builds unproven blocks with all required components
5. **Proof Generation**: Coordinates with external services for block SNARK proofs
6. **Network Injection**: Broadcasts completed blocks via transition frontier

### Timing Management
- **Slot Boundaries**: Ensures production occurs within 3-minute slot windows
- **Best Tip Tracking**: Maintains won slots valid for current blockchain state
- **Production Delays**: 1-second broadcast delay for network time synchronization
- **Sync Awareness**: Pauses production during frontier synchronization

## Service Integration

### VRF Evaluator Subcomponent
- **Slot Leadership**: Determines eligibility based on stake and VRF evaluation
- **Epoch Management**: Handles epoch transitions and staking ledger switches
- **Won Slot Caching**: Provides future slot wins for production scheduling

### Ledger Service
- **Transaction Retrieval**: Gets pending transactions sorted by fee priority
- **Staged Ledger Diff**: Creates valid state transitions with transaction inclusion
- **State Validation**: Ensures proper coinbase, fee, and proof handling

### External Proof Services
- **Block Proving**: Requests SNARK proofs for complete block validation
- **Proof Integration**: Incorporates proofs into final block structure

### P2P Network
- **Block Broadcasting**: Injects blocks into gossip network via transition frontier
- **Network Timing**: Coordinates broadcast timing for consistent propagation

## Technical Debt

### Critical Issues
- **Block Proof Failure Handling**: `BlockProducerEvent::BlockProve` includes error handling via `Result<Arc<MinaBaseProofStableV2>, String>`, but error cases trigger `todo!()` panics in event source processing rather than proper error sink service integration for graceful failure handling
- **Currency Overflow Handling**: `todo!("total_currency overflowed")` in block production when currency calculations overflow, indicating incomplete edge case handling
- **Missing Error Recovery**: No fallback mechanisms for proof failures - system should integrate with error sink service instead of panicking
