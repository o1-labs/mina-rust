# Mina Codebase Navigation Guide

This file helps understand and navigate the Mina codebase structure.

## Project Overview

Mina is a Rust implementation of the Mina Protocol, a lightweight blockchain
using zero-knowledge proofs. It follows a Redux-style state machine architecture
for predictable, debuggable behavior.

_For detailed architecture documentation, see
[`docs/handover/`](docs/handover/)_

## Architecture Overview

### State Machine Pattern

The codebase follows Redux principles:

- **State** - Centralized, immutable data structure
- **Actions** - Events that trigger state changes
- **Enabling Conditions** - Guards that prevent invalid state transitions
- **Reducers** - Functions that update state and dispatch new actions
- **Effects** - Thin wrappers for service calls
- **Services** - Separate threads handling I/O and heavy computation

### Architecture Styles

- **New Style**: Unified reducers that handle both state updates and action
  dispatch
- **Old Style**: Separate reducer and effects files (being migrated)

## Project Structure

### Core Components

**node/** - Main node logic

- `block_producer/` - Block production
- `transaction_pool/` - Transaction mempool
- `transition_frontier/` - Consensus and blockchain state
- `snark_pool/` - SNARK work management
- `ledger/` - Ledger operations
- `rpc/` - External API
- `event_source/` - Event routing
- `service/` - Service implementations

**p2p/** - Networking layer

- Dual transport: libp2p and WebRTC
- Channel abstractions for message types
- Peer discovery and connection management

**snark/** - Proof verification orchestration

**ledger/** - Ledger implementation, transaction logic, core transaction pool
logic, staged ledger, scan state, and proof verification

**core/** - Shared types and utilities

## Code Organization

### File Patterns

- `*_state.rs` - State definitions
- `*_actions.rs` - Action types
- `*_reducer.rs` - State transitions
- `*_effects.rs` - Service interactions
- `*_service.rs` - Service interfaces
- `summary.md` - Component documentation and technical debt notes

### Key Files

- `node/src/state.rs` - Global state structure
- `node/src/action.rs` - Top-level action enum
- `node/src/reducer.rs` - Main reducer dispatch

## Understanding the Flow

1. **Actions** flow through the system as events
2. **Enabling conditions** check if actions are valid
3. **Reducers** process actions to update state
4. **Effects** trigger service calls when needed
5. **Services** handle async operations and send events back

## Key Patterns

### Defensive Programming

- `bug_condition!` macro marks theoretically unreachable code paths
- Used after enabling condition checks for invariant validation

### State Methods

- Complex logic extracted from reducers into state methods
- Keeps reducers focused on orchestration

### Callbacks

- Enable decoupled component communication
- Used for async operation completion

## Finding Code

```bash
# Find specific actions
rg "YourAction" --type rust

# Find reducers
rg "reducer.*Substate" --type rust

# Find services
rg "impl.*Service" --type rust

# Check component documentation
find . -name "summary.md" -path "*/component/*"
```

## Component Documentation

Each component directory contains a `summary.md` file documenting:

- Component purpose and responsibilities
- Known technical debt
- Implementation notes
- Refactoring plans

## Documentation Website

Mina includes a comprehensive documentation website built with Docusaurus:

### Quick Access

```bash
# Start local documentation server
make docs-serve

# Build documentation
make docs-build

# Other documentation commands
make help | grep docs
```

The website is available at http://localhost:3000 when running locally.

### Structure

- **Node Runners** (`website/docs/node-runners/`) - Installation and operation
  guides
- **Developers** (`website/docs/developers/`) - Architecture and contribution
  guides
- **Researchers** (`website/docs/researchers/`) - Protocol and cryptography
  documentation

### Adding Documentation

1. Create markdown files in the appropriate `website/docs/` subdirectory
2. Add frontmatter with title, description, and sidebar position
3. Update `website/sidebars.ts` if needed for navigation

The website supports versioning and will be automatically deployed when commits
are made to `develop` or when tags are created.

### OCaml Reference Tracking

The Rust codebase maintains references to the corresponding OCaml implementation
to track correspondence and detect when updates are needed.

**Comment format:**

```rust
/// OCaml reference: src/lib/mina_base/transaction_status.ml L:9-113
/// Commit: 55582d249cdb225f722dbbb3b1420ce7570d501f
/// Last verified: 2025-10-08
pub enum TransactionFailure {
    // ...
}
```

**Validation:**

```bash
# Check all OCaml references
./.github/scripts/check-ocaml-refs.sh

# Update stale commit hashes
./.github/scripts/check-ocaml-refs.sh --update

# Check against specific branch
./.github/scripts/check-ocaml-refs.sh --branch develop
```

The validation script verifies that referenced OCaml files exist, line ranges
are valid, code at the referenced commit matches the current branch, and tracks
commit staleness. A GitHub Actions workflow runs weekly to automatically update
references and create PRs.

## Claude Development Guidelines

This section contains specific instructions for Claude when working on this
project.

### Formatting Commands

After making any code modifications, run the appropriate formatting commands:

#### Markdown and MDX Files

- **Format**: Run `make format-md` after modifying any markdown (.md) or MDX
  (.mdx) files
- **Check**: Run `make check-md` to verify markdown and MDX files are formatted
  correctly

#### Rust and TOML Files

- **Format**: Run `make format` after modifying any Rust (.rs) or TOML (.toml)
  files
- **Check**: Run `make check-format` to verify Rust and TOML files are formatted
  correctly

### Commit Guidelines

**NEVER** add Claude as a co-author in commit messages. Do not include:

- `Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`
- Any other co-author attribution for Claude

**NEVER** use emojis in commit messages.

**Always** wrap commit message titles at 80 characters and body text at 80
characters.

Always verify commit messages before committing and remove any co-author lines
referencing Claude.

### Development Workflow

1. Make your code changes
2. Run the appropriate formatting command based on file types modified
3. **ALWAYS run `make fix-trailing-whitespace` before committing or ending any
   task**
4. Verify formatting with check commands if needed
5. **Verify commit message does not include Claude as co-author**
6. **Verify commit message contains no emojis and follows 80-character wrap**
7. Proceed with testing or committing changes

### Documentation Script Display

When adding scripts to documentation, always use Docusaurus CodeBlock imports:

```mdx
import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import ScriptName from "!!raw-loader!./path/to/script.sh";

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="path/to/script.sh">
  {ScriptName}
</CodeBlock>
```

This ensures scripts are displayed accurately and stay in sync with the actual
files.

### Documentation Style Guidelines

**Capitalization in headings and bullet points:**

- Capitalize the first letter of section headings (e.g., "Test design",
  "Resource management")
- Use lowercase for bullet point labels (e.g., "**connection policies**",
  "**state inspection**")
- Maintain proper capitalization for proper nouns and technical terms
- Apply this style consistently across all documentation files

**Docusaurus admonitions (:::note, :::caution, :::info, etc.):**

- Always wrap Docusaurus admonitions with `<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->` and
  `<!-- prettier-ignore-stop -->` comments
- This prevents prettier from reformatting the admonition blocks
- Example:

  ```mdx
  <!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

  :::note Content of the note here :::

  <!-- prettier-ignore-stop -->
  ```

### Documentation Script Testing

When modifying developer setup scripts in `website/docs/developers/scripts/`,
always test them using the documentation testing workflow:

#### Testing Documentation Scripts

The project includes automated testing of developer setup scripts to ensure they
work correctly across different platforms. This prevents developers from
encountering broken installation instructions.

**When to test:**

- After modifying any script in `website/docs/developers/scripts/setup/`
- When adding new dependencies or tools to the setup process
- When changing installation procedures
- When adding support for a new distribution or platform

**How to trigger tests:**

1. **For PRs**: Add the `test-doc-scripts` label to your pull request
2. **Manual testing**: Use GitHub CLI:
   `gh pr edit <PR_NUMBER> --add-label test-doc-scripts`
3. **Remove and re-add**: If tests need to be re-run, remove the label first:
   ```bash
   gh pr edit <PR_NUMBER> --remove-label test-doc-scripts
   gh pr edit <PR_NUMBER> --add-label test-doc-scripts
   ```

**What gets tested:**

- System dependencies installation (Ubuntu/macOS)
- Rust toolchain setup (including taplo, wasm-pack, etc.)
- Node.js installation
- Docker installation
- Build processes and formatting tools
- Tool version verification

**Why this matters:**

- Ensures documentation stays current with actual requirements
- Prevents "command not found" errors for new developers
- Tests across multiple platforms (Ubuntu 22.04, 24.04, macOS)
- Catches environment drift and dependency changes
- Runs nightly to detect breaking changes early

The tests are designed to run on-demand via labels to avoid slowing down regular
development workflow, as they can take significant time to complete.

### CHANGELOG Guidelines

When making significant changes that affect users or developers, update the
CHANGELOG.md file:

#### CHANGELOG Structure

The CHANGELOG follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format
with these sections under `## [Unreleased]`:

- **OCaml node** - Changes related to OCaml node compatibility
- **Added** - New features and functionality
- **Changed** - Changes to existing functionality
- **Fixed** - Bug fixes
- **Dependencies** - Dependency updates

#### Entry Format

- Use this format: `- **Category**: Description ([#PR](github-link))`
- Wrap entries at 80 characters with proper indentation
- Categories include: CI, Build System, Documentation, Development Tools, etc.
- Always reference the PR number

#### CHANGELOG Commit Pattern

- Commit message: `CHANGELOG: add entry for patch XXXX`
- Where XXXX is the PR number
- Keep the commit message simple and consistent with existing pattern

Example entry:

```markdown
- **CI**: Generalized build jobs to support multiple platforms (Ubuntu 22.04,
  Ubuntu 24.04, Ubuntu 24.04 ARM, macOS latest) and updated test execution to
  ubuntu-latest ([#1249](https://github.com/o1-labs/openmina/pull/1249))
```

### CI Optimization Guidelines

When modifying CI workflows, especially for performance improvements:

#### Build Job Dependencies

- **Separate "builds for tests" from "builds for verification"**: Create
  dedicated single-platform build jobs that produce only the artifacts needed
  for testing. This allows tests to start as soon as required artifacts are
  available, not waiting for all cross-platform builds to complete.

- **Use selective dependencies**: Instead of depending on matrix build jobs
  (which include all platforms), create specific build jobs that tests can
  depend on. For example:

  ```yaml
  # Before: Tests wait for all platforms
  needs: [build, build-tests]  # Matrix across 7 platforms

  # After: Tests wait for specific artifact-producing builds
  needs: [build-for-tests, build-tests-for-tests]  # Single platform
  ```

- **Maintain cross-platform coverage**: Keep matrix builds for platform
  verification but don't let them block test execution. They should run in
  parallel for verification purposes.

- **Artifact consistency**: Ensure dedicated build jobs produce the same
  artifact names that test jobs expect. Use patterns like
  `bin-${{ github.sha }}` and `tests-${{ github.sha }}` consistently.

#### Performance Considerations

- Tests typically only need artifacts from ubuntu-22.04 builds (for container
  compatibility)
- macOS builds often take longest and shouldn't block Linux-based test execution
- Use ubuntu-22.04 for artifact production to ensure GLIBC compatibility with
  Debian-based test containers

### Critical Pre-Commit Requirements

- **MANDATORY**: Run `make fix-trailing-whitespace` before every commit
- **MANDATORY**: Run `make check-trailing-whitespace` to verify no trailing
  whitespaces remain
- This applies to ALL file modifications, regardless of file type
- Trailing whitespaces are strictly prohibited in the codebase
