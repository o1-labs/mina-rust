# PubSub State Machine

Implements gossip protocol for message broadcasting across the P2P network.

## Purpose
- Manages topic subscriptions for blockchain data
- Routes messages to subscribers using mesh topology
- Implements flood-fill gossip with deduplication
- Handles message validation and caching

## Key Components
- **Message Cache**: Stores and manages message lifecycle and validation states
- **Mesh Manager**: Maintains peer topology for efficient gossip propagation
- **Subscription Manager**: Handles topic subscriptions and peer interests
- **Message Validator**: Validates incoming messages and handles routing

## Interactions
- Subscribes to blockchain topics (blocks, transactions, SNARKs)
- Broadcasts blocks and transactions to network
- Forwards messages from peers based on subscriptions
- Manages gossip mesh topology and peer relationships
- Handles message deduplication and validation

## Technical Debt

This component has significant complexity and performance issues. See [p2p_network_pubsub_refactoring.md](./p2p_network_pubsub_refactoring.md) for detailed analysis.

### Major Issues
- **Massive Reducer (963 lines)**: Single file handling multiple concerns that should be moved to state methods for better maintainability
- **Performance Problems**: O(n) message lookups (state.rs:395-406) and unbounded memory growth
- **Mixed Responsibilities**: State struct handles caching, peer management, and protocol logic simultaneously

### Moderate Issues  
- **Incomplete Functionality**: Missing source tracking for messages (reducer.rs:300), platform compatibility concerns (state.rs:253)
- **Hard-coded Constants**: Non-configurable timeouts (5s, 300s) and magic numbers (3, 10, 50, 100) scattered throughout
- **Suboptimal Data Structures**: TODO to separate storage by message type (state.rs:214) would improve efficiency

### Refactoring Plan
1. **Move message handling logic to state methods** to reduce reducer complexity
2. **Implement proper indexing** to eliminate O(n) lookups  
3. **Extract separate managers** for caching, peer management, and subscriptions
4. **Make constants configurable** through P2P configuration system
