# Outgoing Connection State Machine

Manages outgoing WebRTC and libp2p connection establishment from offer creation through connection finalization.

## Purpose
- **WebRTC connection initiation** - Creates and sends encrypted SDP offers to target peers
- **Dual transport support** - Handles both WebRTC (browser-based) and libp2p (backend) outgoing connections
- **Offer creation workflow** - Generates SDP offers, encrypts them, and sends via signaling channels
- **Connection completion** - Processes answers and finalizes connection establishment

## State Flow
```
Init → OfferSdpCreatePending → OfferSdpCreateSuccess → OfferReady → OfferSendSuccess → AnswerRecvPending → AnswerRecvSuccess → FinalizePending → Success
     → Error (failure cases)
```

## Key Features
- **SDP offer creation** - Generates WebRTC Session Description Protocol offers for outgoing connections
- **Signaling method coordination** - Routes offers through HTTP signaling or P2P signaling channels
- **Answer processing** - Receives and processes encrypted SDP answers from target peers
- **Callback support** - Executes success callbacks with peer ID and RPC ID upon connection establishment
- **Timeout management** - Configurable timeouts for outgoing connection attempts

## Integration Points
- **P2pConnectionOutgoingEffectfulAction::Init** - Initiates WebRTC offer creation process
- **P2pNetworkSchedulerAction::OutgoingConnect** - Integrates with libp2p connection scheduler
- **Signaling channels** - Coordinates with discovery and exchange channels for offer/answer routing
- **P2pPeerAction** - Updates peer state upon successful connection establishment

## Technical Implementation
- **Encrypted offer handling** - Uses `Box<webrtc::Offer>` for encrypted SDP offers
- **Callback mechanism** - Redux callbacks for decoupled success notification
- **Connection options** - Supports `P2pConnectionOutgoingInitOpts::WebRTC` and `::LibP2P`
- **Error state management** - Comprehensive error handling with rejection reasons

## Technical Debt

### Critical Issues
- **Missing DNS Resolution**: libp2p connections lack DNS resolution implementation in `Init` and `Reconnect` actions, causing connection failures for domain-based addresses

### Major Issues
- **Complex State Machine**: Large monolithic reducer with multiple responsibilities makes maintenance difficult
- **Insufficient Input Validation**: String parsing for peer addresses lacks robust validation in address conversion

### Moderate Issues
- **Resource Management**: Extensive use of `Box<>` allocations without clear cleanup patterns may cause memory leaks
- **Incomplete Timeout Logic**: Timeout handling only applies to non-error states in timeout checking
- **Basic Error Mapping**: Simplistic error conversion loses debugging detail in error handling
- TODO: Replace hard-coded signaling server host with actual address (WebRTC offers currently use 127.0.0.1)
- TODO: Remove host field from offers and use ICE candidates instead for signaling server identification
- TODO: Rename `Init` and `Reconnect` actions to `New` and `Connect` for clearer semantics
- TODO: Move outgoing connection types to `crate::webrtc` module for better organization
