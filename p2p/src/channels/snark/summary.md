# SNARK Channel State Machine

Transport-agnostic SNARK work distribution channel that abstracts over both libp2p gossip and WebRTC pull-based protocols.

## Purpose
- **Transport abstraction** - Provides unified interface for SNARK work propagation over libp2p (gossip/pubsub) and WebRTC (request/response)
- **Protocol adaptation** - Handles push-based broadcasting for libp2p and pull-based requests for WebRTC
- **Flow control** - Implements request/response protocol for WebRTC peers with count-based limits
- **Network-wide distribution** - Ensures SNARK work reaches all network participants regardless of transport

## Key Components
- **Request Handler**: Manages GetNext/WillSend/Snark protocol flow
- **Distribution Manager**: Tracks work distribution state per peer
- **Broadcast Handler**: Manages work propagation via gossip
- **State Tracker**: Maintains request/response state for local and remote peers

## Interactions
- Broadcasts new SNARK work when available in pool
- Forwards work received from other peers
- Deduplicates work for libp2p transport (but not WebRTC)
- Integrates with local SNARK pool for work availability
- Handles both push (broadcast) and pull (request) distribution models

## Technical Debt

### Minor Issues
- **Inconsistent Deduplication**: WebRTC path lacks duplicate check while libp2p has it (different transport requirements may explain this difference)
- **State Methods**: Could benefit from additional helper methods to reduce pattern matching in reducer

### Note on Architecture
This channel provides a transport abstraction layer between inner logic components and libp2p/WebRTC transports for SNARK work distribution. Validation and security concerns are properly handled by the SNARK pool and other inner logic components that use this abstraction.
