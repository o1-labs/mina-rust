# SNARK Job Commitment Channel State Machine

**Legacy Component**: This channel is a legacy component from a time before OpenMina was a complete node. OpenMina has since implemented a more advanced SNARK worker synchronization mechanism, making this commitment-based approach obsolete.

## Purpose
- Originally designed to broadcast SNARK job commitments to coordinate work assignments
- Intended to prevent duplicate work among distributed SNARK workers
