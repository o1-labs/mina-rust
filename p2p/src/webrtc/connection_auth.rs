//! WebRTC connection authentication.
//!
//! This module provides cryptographic authentication for WebRTC connections
//! using SDP hashes and public key encryption to prevent man-in-the-middle
//! attacks. The authentication mechanism ensures that WebRTC connections are
//! established only between legitimate peers with verified identities.
//!
//! ## Security Model
//!
//! The connection authentication process works by:
//!
//! 1. **SDP Hash Combination**: Combining the SDP hashes from both the WebRTC
//!    offer and answer to create a unique authentication token
//! 2. **Public Key Encryption**: Encrypting the authentication data using the
//!    recipient's public key to ensure only they can decrypt it
//! 3. **Mutual Verification**: Both parties verify each other's ability to
//!    decrypt the authentication data, proving they possess the correct private
//!    keys
//!
//! ## Authentication Flow
//!
//! ```text
//! Peer A                                    Peer B
//!   |                                         |
//!   |  1. Create Offer (with SDP)            |
//!   |------------------------------------>   |
//!   |                                         |
//!   |  2. Create Answer (with SDP)           |
//!   |   <------------------------------------|
//!   |                                         |
//!   |  3. Generate ConnectionAuth from       |
//!   |     both SDP hashes                    |
//!   |                                         |
//!   |  4. Encrypt with peer's public key     |
//!   |------------------------------------>   |
//!   |                                         |
//!   |  5. Decrypt and verify                 |
//!   |   <------------------------------------|
//!   |                                         |
//!   |  6. Connection authenticated ✓         |
//! ```
//!
//! ## Security Properties
//!
//! - **Identity Verification**: Ensures both parties possess the private keys
//!   corresponding to their advertised public keys
//! - **Man-in-the-Middle Protection**: Prevents attackers from intercepting and
//!   modifying the connection establishment process
//! - **Replay Attack Prevention**: Uses unique SDP hashes for each connection
//!   attempt, preventing replay attacks

/// Connection authentication data derived from WebRTC signaling.
///
/// `ConnectionAuth` contains the authentication material generated from the
/// SDP (Session Description Protocol) hashes of both the WebRTC offer and
/// answer.
/// This creates a unique, connection-specific authentication token that can be
/// used to verify the authenticity of the WebRTC connection.
///
/// ## Construction
///
/// The authentication data is created by concatenating the SDP hashes from both
/// the offer and answer messages:
///
/// ```text
/// ConnectionAuth = SDP_Hash(Offer) || SDP_Hash(Answer)
/// ```
///
/// This ensures that both parties contributed to the authentication material
/// and that any tampering with either the offer or answer would be detected.
///
/// ## Security Properties
///
/// - **Uniqueness**: Each connection attempt generates unique SDP data,
///   preventing replay attacks
/// - **Integrity**: Any modification to the offer or answer changes the hashes,
///   invalidating the authentication
/// - **Binding**: Cryptographically binds the authentication to the specific
///   WebRTC session parameters
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```rust
/// # use p2p::webrtc::{ConnectionAuth, Offer, Answer};
/// # use p2p::identity::{SecretKey, PublicKey};
/// # use rand::thread_rng;
/// # fn example(offer: &Offer, answer: &Answer,
/// #            my_secret_key: &SecretKey, peer_public_key: &PublicKey)
/// # -> Option<()> {
/// # let mut rng = thread_rng();
/// let connection_auth = ConnectionAuth::new(&offer, &answer);
/// let encrypted_auth = connection_auth.encrypt(&my_secret_key, &peer_public_key, &mut rng)?;
/// # Some(())
/// # }
/// ```

pub struct ConnectionAuth(Vec<u8>);

/// Encrypted connection authentication data.
///
/// `ConnectionAuthEncrypted` represents the connection authentication data after
/// it has been encrypted using public key cryptography. The encrypted data is
/// stored in a fixed-size array of 92 bytes, which corresponds to the output
/// size of the encryption algorithm used.
///
/// ## Encryption Process
///
/// The encryption uses the recipient's public key to ensure that only the
/// intended recipient can decrypt and verify the authentication data. This
/// prevents man-in-the-middle attackers from forging authentication tokens.
///
/// ## Fixed Size
///
/// The 92-byte fixed size is determined by the cryptographic parameters:
/// - The encryption algorithm produces a deterministic output size
/// - Fixed sizing enables efficient serialization and network transmission
/// - Prevents information leakage through size analysis
///
/// ## Network Transmission
///
/// This type is designed for transmission over the network and includes
/// serialization support for JSON and binary formats.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```rust
/// # use p2p::webrtc::ConnectionAuthEncrypted;
/// # use p2p::identity::{SecretKey, PublicKey};
/// # fn example(encrypted_auth: &ConnectionAuthEncrypted,
/// #            my_secret_key: &SecretKey, peer_public_key: &PublicKey)
/// # -> Option<()> {
/// // After receiving encrypted authentication data
/// let decrypted_auth = encrypted_auth.decrypt(&my_secret_key, &peer_public_key)?;
/// // Verify that the decrypted data matches expected values
/// # Some(())
/// # }
/// ```
