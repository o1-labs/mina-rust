/// Protocol constraint constants that define core blockchain behavior.
///
/// These constants configure fundamental aspects of the Mina protocol including consensus,
/// transaction processing, economic parameters, and ledger structure. They are compile-time
/// parameters that must be consistent across all nodes in a network.
///
/// ## Consensus and Timing Parameters
///
/// The consensus mechanism relies on slot-based timing where blocks are produced in discrete
/// time slots. The timing hierarchy is:
/// - **Slots**: Basic time units for block production
/// - **Sub-windows**: Groups of slots within an epoch
/// - **Windows**: Collections of sub-windows that define epoch structure
/// - **Epochs**: Complete consensus periods
///
/// ## Economic Parameters
///
/// The protocol defines economic incentives through fees and rewards:
/// - **Coinbase rewards**: Paid to block producers for successful blocks
/// - **Account creation fees**: Required to create new accounts on the ledger
/// - **Supercharged rewards**: Multiplier for enhanced block producer rewards
///
/// ## Ledger and Transaction Structure
///
/// The ledger uses a Merkle tree structure for efficient verification:
/// - **Ledger depth**: Determines the maximum number of accounts (2^depth)
/// - **Transaction capacity**: Limits transactions per block for performance
/// - **Pending coinbase**: Manages delayed coinbase payouts
///
/// ## Usage Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use openmina_core::constants::constraint_constants;
///
/// // Access global constraint constants
/// let constants = constraint_constants();
///
/// // Calculate slots per window
/// let slots_per_window = constants.sub_windows_per_window;
/// println!("Sub-windows per window: {}", slots_per_window);
///
/// // Get block timing
/// let block_time_ms = constants.block_window_duration_ms;
/// println!("Block time: {}ms", block_time_ms);
///
/// // Check economic parameters
/// let coinbase_reward = constants.coinbase_amount;
/// let creation_fee = constants.account_creation_fee;
/// println!("Coinbase: {} nanomina, Account fee: {} nanomina",
///          coinbase_reward, creation_fee);
/// ```
///
/// ## Network Differences
///
/// While most constraint constants are identical across networks, some parameters
/// may differ between mainnet and testnets for development purposes.
///
/// Related OCaml implementation: <https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/tree/compatible/src/config>
/// Protocol specification: <https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/blob/compatible/docs/specs/types_and_structures/serialized_key.md>
